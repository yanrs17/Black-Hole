## Objective
The object of the game is to stop black holes from eating the solar system – planets, nebulae, alien spacecraft, space junk – by quickly clicking on all of the black holes as they appear before the time is up.

## Description
Before you is a solar system filled with all sorts of objects: planets, moons, nebulae, asteroids, spacecraft, space junk, and more. However, black holes appear every few seconds and start to pull objects towards them! If an object hits the centre of a black hole, the black hole eats it, meaning a loss of 50 points from your starting total of 200 points. Additionally, once a black hole has had its fill, it will disappear back into the ether.

The game is time-based, and each level lasts 60 seconds. The game moves on to the next level or ends if it’s the last level when the time is up or when the black holes have eaten all of the objects in the solar system. If at least one object remains, you can move on to the next level.

There are three types of black holes in the game: blue (slow pull), purple (medium pull), and black (fast pull). Each time you destroy (mouse click) a black hole, you receive points (but all objects it’s eaten are gone forever): 5 for blue, 10 for purple, and 20 for black. Once a black hole has eaten a certain number of objects – 3 for blue, 2 for purple, and 1 for black - it will disappear, meaning you lose the opportunity to earn points.
